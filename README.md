## SherlockShrub
### Your Personal Plant Detective

#### What is SherlockShrub?

SherlockShrub is a plant identifier. Give it any image and it will give you a list of plants it thinks that it is. The higher the probability, the more likely it is the plant you gave the image.

There are also different pieces of information it gives, like edible parts, propagation methods and watering levels.

Edible parts are just the part of the plant you can digest and use for medicinal purposes.

Propagation methods are the ways that the plant can spread throughout.

Watering levels have 4 different levels. 
- None: No watering needed
- 1: Low watering needed
- 2: Medium watering needed
- 3: High watering needed

Other things include the main name (Scientific name) which is the title of every box, and the common name, shown in a tiny box to the top left of the image, which is what the plant is commonly referred to.
